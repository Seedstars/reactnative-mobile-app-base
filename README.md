### Required Configuration

You need to edit the environment files to be able to use external SDKs (facebook, analysis, onesignal, etc) and also access backend.
The files are in root of project and are called: .env.local_dev, .env.production and .env.staging.


### Development

Export needed variables

* `$ export ANDROID_HOME=~/Android/Sdk`
* `$ export PATH=${PATH}:${ANDROID_HOME}/tools:${ANDROID_HOME}/platform-tools`

Start react-native development server

* `$ npm run start`

Run app on emulator

* `$ ENVFILE=.env.local_dev react-native run-android  # or any other .env`

## Testing

Confirm that the current app version don't have a staging version in codepush, other wise it will download the update.

* `code-push deployment ls "Seedstars Base" -k`


### Static analysis

* `$ npm run lintjs`

### Deploy

* increment app version in `.env.production`

* `$ cd android && ENVFILE=.env.production ./gradlew assembleRelease`

### CodePush Deploy
 if you have not registered in Codepush do:

 * `$ code-push register`

 In case you have already registered you should run:

 * `$ code-push collaborator add <appName> <collaboratorEmail>`

 After that you can do a release:
